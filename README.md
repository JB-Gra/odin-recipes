# Welcome to Odin Recipes!
## Description
Odin Recipes is a small website with a few recipes, created as a result of the [recipes project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) solution for The Odin's Project Foundations course.
## Takeaways from the project
This project was made to demonstrate the student's skills with HTML and (*soon enough*) CSS languages, such as elements and tags, structure, headings, images, links and lists.

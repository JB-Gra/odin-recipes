        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of white sugar</li>
            <li>1 can of condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 can of evaporated milk</li>
            <li>6 medium eggs</li>
            <li>1 cream cheese bar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven at 180 °C (356 °F) for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a aluminum oven mould or <em>flanera</em>, put the white sugar cup and heat it until it becomes a golden liquid. This will be our caramel, so be careful not to burn it. Reserve.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients in a blender and pour your blend inside the aluminum mould with the caramel and cover it with tin foil.</li>
            <li>Put the mould in an oven-proof pyrex glass roaster with warm water. The water must reach half of the aluminum mould. Depending of your oven power, bake around 45 minutes or 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Take it out from the oven and let it cool enough to put it inside the fridge. Let it sit for around 4 hours or overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Cut in slices and serve. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
